# Introduction #

This is the first post of this project, YAY! We're going public and open source with this one, allowing anyone to reuse our code for whatever they want, hopefully to learn something, or make something awesome.

The purpose of this project is to create an easy, school diary-like application, with additional features, which will run (legitimately) on government provided DER laptops which have high security and feature restrictions.

For the abovementioned reasons, we have chosen to construct this project in Flex, with Adobe Air (AS3). Originally intended to use Flash, the insufficient file handling (especially writing) features could not suffice to handle data of the magnitude required by this project.

Flex 3 will be used, because, we believe that the Halo theme will suit well with our project.

The one main concern is the insufficient privileges require to unpack and install an Adobe Air application. As this isn't a very formal project, we'll have to run it straight from the Debug Launcher (which is provided with Flex Builder). A batch file will automate the tedious process of launching the application from the command line.

We're almost at our first release, so check back soon for work-in-progress screenies as well as more info on this project.
