ReadMe File for VM Student Organiser
====================================

Version
-------
0.1, first alpha release for DER.

Authors
-------
VM, Vibrant Metropolis
Graphics and Design: David Zhao
Development: Joshua Lau

Issues
------
If you have any problems, post an appropriate issue on the project website at
http://code.google.com/p/vm-student-organiser/ (issues tab) or drop us an email.

Setup
-----
Simply run setup.bat by double-clicking it and it'll setup your organiser for you.
NOTE: it creates a directory called 'Organiser' in your %HOMEPATH% (usually
C:\Users\<username>\). If an existing directory there has the same name, you should
move it or post an issue.

You can run the application by running run.bat by double-clicking it and it'll pop up
with your personal organiser!

The first thing you'll want to do is click on the Preferences tab and punch in your
name and class, then fill in your timetable in the grid below by clicking and selecting
subjects from the drop down boxes. If you don't have a period at a given time, leave it
blank. Feel free to post an issue if one of your subjects isn't listed.

When you're done, hit save. It might be a little bit of a wait before functionality returns
(setting up your organiser for the rest of the year takes a while). Then you're done!
