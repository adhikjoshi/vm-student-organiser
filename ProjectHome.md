# Software Requirements #
Either:
  * A DER laptop, or;
  * A computer with Adobe AIR installed. Get it [here](http://get.adobe.com/air/)

# Notices #

  * Apologies that the .air installer is not properly signed
  * When running the app on a **DER**, the -der.zip file should be downloaded. Otherwise, use the -all.air file.
  * The .air **will not** run on a DER due to permission issues
  * In v1.0 (first Beta), we've left in ugly grey error boxes that popup every now and then, so if you get one, post a new issue [here](http://code.google.com/p/vm-student-organiser/issues/list) with its **entire contents**. (Note: you will need a Google account to post an issue)

# Feedback #
